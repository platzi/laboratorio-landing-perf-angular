        For some systems, latency and throughput are coupled entities. In
        TCP/IP, latency can also directly affect throughput. In TCP connections,
        the large bandwidth-delay product of high latency connections, combined
        with relatively small TCP window sizes on many devices, effectively
        causes the throughput of a high latency connection to drop sharply with
        latency. <br /><br />
        This can be remedied with various techniques, such as increasing the TCP
        congestion window size, or more drastic solutions, such as packet
        coalescing, TCP acceleration, and forward error correction, all of which
        are commonly used for high latency satellite links.
